Tournament Mode User Guide:

Woogles' tournament mode offers native tournament pairings, standings, and results capabilities. It also offers a much smoother experience for players, making it much easier for them to start their matches and making it impossible for them to start a game against the wrong opponent in the tournament room.

If you have a question about tournament mode, please refer to this guide first, and if you are still confused, send an email to woogles@woogles.io.

**Please note that Tournament Mode is still in beta. The Woogles team cannot offer realtime tournament mode support, and we highly recommend that directors start by running small, short tournaments to familiarize themselves with the tournament mode software.**

The Director(s) are responsible for the following:
1. Setting up divisions, which allow you to split players based on your/their preferences (skill level, dictionary, time controls, challenge rule, etc.)
2. Registering players for their respective divisions
3. Setting up pairing rules and adjusting pairings as needed throughout the tournament.
4. Starting each round of the tournament
5. Any additional manual adjustments that are not covered by our tournament mode (for example, dropping players from the tournament or adjusting game scores for games where a player times out.)
6. Making sure the players know how to start tournament games, find your tournament page, and have some familiarity with Woogles.
7. Make sure the players comply with both Woogles' rules and your own rules.
